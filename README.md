# *ABC Company Employee Data Analysis*

## *Project Overview*

This project involves analyzing a dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, perform various analysis tasks, and present the findings graphically. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of employees across teams, positions, age groups, salary expenditures, and correlations within the dataset.

## *Preprocessing Steps*

1. **Correcting the 'Height' Column :**
- The 'Height' column was corrected by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.

2. **Ensuring Data Consistency and Integrity :**
- Any rows with missing values were removed to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

## *Analysis Tasks*

1. **Distribution of Employees Across Each Team :**
- The number of employees in each team was calculated.
- The percentage split relative to the total number of employees was determined.

2. **Segregation of Employees Based on Positions :**
- Employees were categorized based on their positions within the company.
- The distribution of employees across different positions was analyzed.

3. **Identifying the Predominant Age Group :**
- Employees were grouped into age categories (20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40).
- The predominant age group among employees was identified.

4. **Highest Salary Expenditure :**
- The team and position with the highest total salary expenditure were discovered.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary :**
- The correlation between age and salary was investigated.
- A scatter plot was created to visually represent this correlation.

## *Graphical Representations*

1. **Distribution of Employees Based on Positions :**
- A bar chart was created to visualize the number of employees in each position.

2. **Distribution of Employees Based on Age Groups :**
- A bar chart was created to show the number of employees in each age group.

3. **Team Salary Expenditure :**
- A bar chart was created to display the total salary expenditure for each team.

4. **Position Salary Expenditure :**
- A bar chart was created to show the total salary expenditure for each position.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary :**
- A scatter plot was created to visualize the correlation between age and salary.

## *Insights Gained*

1. **Segregation of Employees Based on Positions :**
- The most common position is **SG** with **87** employees.

2. **Predominant Age Group :**
- The predominant age group among employees is **20-25**.

3. **Highest Salary Expenditure :**
- The team with the highest salary expenditure is **Los Angeles Clippers**.
- The position with the highest salary expenditure is **PG**.

4. **Correlation Between Age and Salary :**
- The correlation coefficient between age and salary is **0.16**, indicating a weak positive correlation.

## *Additional Information*

- The dataset was processed using Python, with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- The analysis and visualizations provide valuable insights into the employee distribution, salary expenditures, and potential correlations within the dataset.
- The findings can help ABC Company make informed decisions regarding employee management and resource allocation.
